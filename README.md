# Structure

This project is divided in two subprojects. Those two subprojects are tightly coupled henceforth explaining they are part of the same repository.

The first one is a Node.js application which purpose is to run a local server. This local server allow to display custom HTML/CSS pages with OBS.

The second one is an SDK plugin which allows interactivity with the local server directly from an Elgato Stream Deck.

Unfortunately the subprojects are unusable on their own.

# Considerations

It is NOT functionnal currently.

DO NOT expect anyhting from this project. I'm just trying to learn thing my own may.
DO NOT judge my design choices. It is my first "real" project.
