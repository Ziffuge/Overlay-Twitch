This is a work in progress project.
The code looks awful but it seems to work.
Still have to learn a lot about all this stuff.

# Notes

- The dockerfile is purposefully empty
- Structure is to be revised but later
- Planning on adding functionnalities (?)

# Stream Deck Compatibility

For now, the following plugin should be considered to make the link between this app and an Elgato Stream Deck :
- [Elgato Market Place](https://marketplace.elgato.com/product/api-request-dc7f3a02-e32c-4daf-b5a9-48c618deb6d1)
- [GitHub](https://github.com/mjbnz/streamdeck-api-request/tree/master)

Planning on creating own plugin but the documentation is pretty bad. I'll have to figure out how it works.
