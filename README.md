This is a work in progress project.
The code looks awful but it seems to work.
Still have to learn a lot about all this stuff.

# Stream Deck Compatibility

For now, the following plugin should be considered to make the link between this app and an Elgato Stream Deck :
- [Elgato Market Place](https://marketplace.elgato.com/product/api-request-dc7f3a02-e32c-4daf-b5a9-48c618deb6d1)
- [GitHub](https://github.com/mjbnz/streamdeck-api-request/tree/master)

Planning on creating own plugin but the documentation is pretty bad. I'll have to figure out how it works.

# Typescript

Recently started using typescript for more rigour and structure. Nonetheless, the (future) stream deck plugin uses javascript because the SDK don't seems to work with typescript (haven't searched but there is already not enough doc for the javascript SDK).

# Notes

- The dockerfile is purposefully empty
- Structure is to be revised but later
- Planning on adding functionnalities (?)
