# Stream Deck Custom Plugin

This plugin allows to interact with the other subproject's local server directly with a stream deck.

## Dependencies

Uses the Elgato SDK. I also used the provided template, which I currently haven't totally cleaned so there might be unused file or assets.

## Actions

### Server Request
Allows user to send predefined custom requests to the local server.

# Download

I am using the DistributionTool provided by Elgato (see [Plugin Packaging](https://docs.elgato.com/sdk/plugins/packaging)).
Hopefully you just need to either :
- download this project and use the tool by yourself on the com.github.ziffuge.sdPlugin directory
- download the streamDeckPlugin file in the Release directory
