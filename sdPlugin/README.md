# Stream Deck Custom Plugin

This plugin allows interaction between the parent project's local server and a stream deck.

## Dependencies

Uses the Elgato SDK. I also used the provided template, which I currently haven't totally cleaned so there might be unused file or assets.

## Actions

### Server Request
Allows user to send predefined custom requests to the local server.
