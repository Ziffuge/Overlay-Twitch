# Local Server

This subproject's purpose is to provide a local server managing HTML/CSS custom pages to be displayed by OBS.
Currently, it only features one interactive page but I hope more will be available in the future.

# Stream Deck Compatibility

The Elgato Stream Deck compatibility is handled by the other subproject. 

# Typescript

Recently started using typescript for more rigour and structure. Nonetheless, the (future) stream deck plugin uses javascript because the SDK don't seems to work with typescript (haven't searched but there is already not enough doc for the javascript SDK).

# Notes

- Could be cool to have something like a database handled by the server but for what goal...
