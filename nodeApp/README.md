# Sub-Project : Node.js App
## Description

This sub-project's purpose is to learn how to use HTML/CSS/Javascript to make a Node.js app.
Currently, it works like a local server to which requests can be send.

Here is a list of currently requestable pages:
- config : not much going on here, future server configuration page
- death_counter : a counter changing color and size with the number

## Usage

A Docker image containing the app is deployed at "ghcr.io/ziffuge/overlay-twitch" with each release.
See [How to Install](../README.md#how-to-install) for instructions.

## Stream Deck Compatibility

The Elgato Stream Deck compatibility is handled by the other sub-project. 

## Typescript

In fact, this sub-project uses typescript and not javascript. This choice was made to integrate more rigour in the code. (And also just because I was curious)

## Notes

- name might be a bit silly
- Could be cool to have something like a database handled by the server but for what goal...
